# üîçMan-in-the-Middle-MITM-Attack-Detection-with-Wireshark
This project demonstrates how to detect a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack using **Wireshark** and ARP poisoning analysis. It was created for internship learning purposes and showcases hands-on skills in network security monitoring and traffic analysis.

## üìå Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to understand how MITM attacks work and how to detect them using Wireshark. By simulating a real MITM attack using Ettercap, I learned how to identify signs of ARP poisoning on the network and configure Wireshark profiles for efficient monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Setup

- **Kali Linux (VirtualBox)** ‚Äî Used to run the MITM attack with Ettercap.
- **Ettercap** ‚Äî Tool for performing the MITM attack via ARP poisoning.
- **Windows 10** ‚Äî The target machine for the attack.
- **Wireshark** ‚Äî Used on the victim/monitoring system to detect the attack.
- **Custom Wireshark Profile** ‚Äî Contains filters for detecting ARP spoofing patterns.

## üß™ Project Setup

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Kali Linux and Windows 10 machines are on the same network.
   - Kali is running on VirtualBox with bridged or NAT adapter.
   - Windows 10 is the target of the MITM attack.

2. **MITM Attack Simulation**:
   - On Kali Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo ettercap -G
     ```
   - Targeted both gateway and Windows machine using ARP poisoning.

3. **Detection with Wireshark**:
   - Wireshark is running on the Windows machine.
   - A custom Wireshark profile named `MITM Detection` is used.
   - The filter applied:
     ```wireshark
     ((arp.src.proto_ipv4 == 192.168.254.146) && (arp.opcode == 2)) && !(arp.src.hw_mac == 2c:f0:5d:d4:fc:f9)
     ```
   - This filter helps detect ARP replies with mismatched MAC addresses.

### üñºÔ∏è MITM Attack Detected
> This indicates that **two devices are claiming the same IP address** using different MAC addresses. This is a **classic sign of ARP spoofing**, which is the core technique used in a MITM attack. The attacker is impersonating a legitimate device on the network to intercept traffic between the target and the gateway.
